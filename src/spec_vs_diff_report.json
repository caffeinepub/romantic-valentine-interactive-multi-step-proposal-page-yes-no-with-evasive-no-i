  "summary": "REQ-14 (in-app Share UI with copy-to-clipboard + success state) appears implemented, and REQ-12 (remove external Google Fonts dependency) appears implemented via switching to local/system font stacks. However, REQ-11 (fix production build/root loading issue) is not shown as fixed because index.html still references a dev-time /src/* module entry. REQ-13 (republish and provide a new icp0.io share link) is not evidenced in code changes. Additionally, backend/main.mo was modified to an empty actor without a stated requirement.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Ensure the deployed frontend is a proper production build (not a development entry that depends on /src/* at runtime) and that the app renders successfully at the root icp0.io domain without missing /src/* resources or 404s for entry scripts/styles/assets.",
      "reason": "The diff still shows frontend/index.html loading the app via a Vite-style development entry script at '/src/main.tsx', which is exactly the runtime dependency on /src/* the requirement calls out as broken in production deployments.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on fixing a broken production frontend link/build, removing Google Fonts dependency, adding a Share section, and republishing.
